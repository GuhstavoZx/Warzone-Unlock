> ##  Warzone-Unlock

#### Since its getting out of hand of how many threads there are out there concerning the following, I decided to make this one containing all of them, with steps.

#### All off the dlls worked and were tested on: windows 20h2. windows 1909, and windows 11

#### This thread includes various dlls,all coming in a compiled state

### SOFT UNLOCKER  

##### temporarily unlocks guns blueprints,camos,operators,calling cards)*has both cw and mw mastery camos

### HARD UNLOCKER

##### permanently unlocks all cw guns and their camos, rank 1000, all challanges for operators, maxes cw guns[offsets updated and multiple dll's added to make it work and not crash]


###### Injector compiled one is included in downloads   [Download Injecter](https://github.com/KANKOSHEV/face-injector-v2)

***

STEPS:

#### 1. Turn your antivirus off

#### 2. Download the ZIP and extract it.

#### 3. Inside the main folder there are 2 folders, Soft Unlocks and Hard Unlocks, in the folder hard unlocks there are 26 dll's, you want to start by renaming dllwep1 to dll and injecting using the injector included in the folder(it has a random name), the sequence you want to inject is from dllwep1 all the way to dllChallange22. The game crashes when there are too many weapons and challanges in the list. Before injecting the dll, the injnector is searching for dll.dll meaning ull have to rename each one before using. Go in training mode and plunder training and inject them all one by one without leaving the game.

#### 4. In Soft Unlocks there are 2 files, mw soft unlocks and cw soft unlocks, I recommend injecting on connecting to online services screen. Using the same method of renaming the dlls in step 3.

#### 5. Always run the injector(only exe in folder with a random long name) as administrator.


#### If u do all the steps as described you should have no issues.
